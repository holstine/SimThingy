# SimThingy
SimThingy is a point-and-spring 2d physics modeler that could iterate over physical models to determine best range.  So with a config file you can specify a 2d machine (pullies, struts, winches, platforms, etc) that undergoes forces like gravity and springs to produce motion and for my specific goals to find range of a thrown pumpkin
